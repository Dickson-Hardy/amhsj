# Author Pages Layout Fix

## Issue Summary
The `/author/submit` and `/author/submissions` pages were not properly wrapped in the `AuthorLayout` component, causing them to appear without the proper author portal navigation and styling.

## Root Cause
Both pages were using a basic `<div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">` wrapper instead of being properly wrapped in:
1. `RouteGuard` component for role-based access control
2. `AuthorLayout` component for consistent author portal UI

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/app/author/submit/page.tsx`
- ✅ Added `RouteGuard` import and wrapper with `allowedRoles={["author"]}`
- ✅ Added `AuthorLayout` import and wrapper
- ✅ Updated container structure to work within the layout
- ✅ Fixed JSX closing tags

### 2. Updated `/app/author/submissions/page.tsx`
- ✅ Added `RouteGuard` import and wrapper with `allowedRoles={["author"]}`
- ✅ Added `AuthorLayout` import and wrapper  
- ✅ Updated container structure to work within the layout
- ✅ Updated loading state to also use the layout

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Navigation**: Both pages should now display the author sidebar navigation
2. **Header**: Proper author portal header with user profile dropdown
3. **Layout**: Consistent spacing and styling with other author pages
4. **Access Control**: Only users with "author" role can access these pages
5. **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly layout structure

## Files Modified
- `/app/author/submit/page.tsx` - Added layout wrappers
- `/app/author/submissions/page.tsx` - Added layout wrappers

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/author/submit`
2. Verify the page loads within the author portal layout
3. Check that the sidebar navigation is visible
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/author/submissions` 
5. Verify this page also loads within the author portal layout
6. Test navigation between author pages using the sidebar

## Layout Structure
```tsx
<RouteGuard allowedRoles={["author"]}>
  <AuthorLayout>
    <div className="space-y-8">
      {/* Page content */}
    </div>
  </AuthorLayout>
</RouteGuard>
```

The pages should now properly integrate with the author portal interface and provide a consistent user experience.
