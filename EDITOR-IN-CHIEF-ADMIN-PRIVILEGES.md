# Editor-in-Chief Admin Privileges Implementation

## Overview
Updated the system to grant Editor-in-Chief (`editor-in-chief` role) the same level of access and privileges as System Administrator (`admin` role). This ensures that the Editor-in-Chief has full control over the journal's operations while maintaining their editorial authority.

## Changes Made

### 1. Role Hierarchy Update
**File**: `lib/role-utils.ts`
- **Change**: Updated `getRoleHierarchy()` function
- **Before**: Editor-in-Chief had level 90, Admin had level 100
- **After**: Both Editor-in-Chief and Admin now have level 100 (equal authority)

### 2. Admin Route Access
**File**: `lib/role-utils.ts`
- **Change**: Updated `hasRouteAccess()` function for admin routes
- **Before**: Only `admin` role could access `/admin` routes
- **After**: Both `admin` and `editor-in-chief` roles can access `/admin` routes

### 3. System Management Permissions
**File**: `lib/role-utils.ts`
- **Change**: Updated `getRolePermissions()` function
- **Before**: Only admin could manage system (`canManageSystem`)
- **After**: Both admin and editor-in-chief can manage system

### 4. Role Assignment Capabilities
**File**: `lib/role-utils.ts`
- **Change**: Updated `getAssignableRoles()` function
- **Before**: Editor-in-Chief could only assign roles below level 90
- **After**: Editor-in-Chief can assign any role including admin (except their own to avoid conflicts)

### 5. API Route Protections
Updated all admin API endpoints to accept both `admin` and `editor-in-chief` roles:

#### User Management APIs
- `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` - User listing and management
- `app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts` - Individual user operations
- `app/api/admin/users/[id]/role/route.ts` - Role assignments
- `app/api/admin/users/[id]/status/route.ts` - User status management

#### Reviewer Management APIs
- `app/api/admin/reviewers/route.ts` - Reviewer management
- `app/api/admin/reviewers/[id]/status/route.ts` - Reviewer status
- `app/api/admin/reviewers/invite/route.ts` - Reviewer invitations

#### System Monitoring APIs
- `app/api/admin/logs/route.ts` - System logs and audit trails
- `app/api/admin/analytics/dashboard/route.ts` - Analytics dashboard
- `app/api/admin/system/health/route.ts` - System health monitoring
- `app/api/admin/system/metrics/route.ts` - System metrics
- `app/api/admin/system/audit/route.ts` - Audit logs
- `app/api/admin/system/notifications/route.ts` - System notifications

#### Submission Management APIs
- `app/api/admin/submissions/[id]/reviewers/route.ts` - Reviewer assignments
- `app/api/admin/submissions/[id]/email/route.ts` - Email notifications

### 6. Admin Panel UI Access
**File**: `components/header.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated navigation menu
- **Before**: Only admin users saw "Admin Panel" link
- **After**: Both admin and editor-in-chief users see "Admin Panel" link

### 7. Admin Page Access Controls
**Files**: 
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - User management page
- `app/admin/reviewers/page.tsx` - Reviewer management page
- `app/admin/news-management/page.tsx` - News management page

**Change**: Updated role checking to allow both admin and editor-in-chief access

## Privileges Granted to Editor-in-Chief

### System Administration
- ✅ Full user management (view, edit, delete, role assignment)
- ✅ System health monitoring and metrics
- ✅ Access to audit logs and system notifications
- ✅ Database and system configuration oversight

### User Management
- ✅ Create, update, and delete user accounts
- ✅ Assign and modify user roles (including admin roles)
- ✅ Manage user status (active, suspended, etc.)
- ✅ View user statistics and activity

### Reviewer Management
- ✅ Invite and manage peer reviewers
- ✅ Assign reviewers to submissions
- ✅ Monitor reviewer performance and workload
- ✅ Update reviewer status and capabilities

### Editorial Operations

- ✅ Special issue and production oversight
- ✅ Email and notification management

### Analytics & Reporting
- ✅ Access to all system analytics

- ✅ User engagement and submission statistics
- ✅ System health and performance monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Role Conflict Prevention
- Editor-in-Chief cannot assign `editor-in-chief` role to others (prevents role conflicts)
- Self-modification restrictions apply (cannot remove own admin privileges)
- Audit logging tracks all administrative actions

### Access Control Maintenance
- All existing admin routes now accept both roles
- Session validation ensures proper authentication
- Role hierarchy prevents privilege escalation beyond intended levels

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing admin users retain all privileges
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All current admin workflows continue to work

### Future Considerations
- Consider implementing role-specific audit trails
- May want to add granular permission system in the future
- Could implement delegation features for specific admin tasks
