## 🎯 Editorial Assistant Routing Fix

### **Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced Middleware**: Added special handling for editorial assistant routes in the main middleware function to redirect unauthenticated users to `/editorial-assistant/login` instead of the general login page.

2. **Proper Role-Based Access**: Ensured that editorial assistant routes properly check for the `editorial-assistant` role (and admin/managing editor access).

### **How it works now:**

#### **For Unauthenticated Users:**
- Accessing `/editorial-assistant` → Redirected to `/editorial-assistant/login?callbackUrl=/editorial-assistant`
- After login → Redirected back to `/editorial-assistant`

#### **For Authenticated Users:**
- ✅ Editorial Assistant role → Access granted to `/editorial-assistant`
- ✅ Admin/Managing Editor roles → Access granted (supervisory access)
- ❌ Other roles → Redirected to `/dashboard`

#### **Login Flow:**
1. User visits `/editorial-assistant`
2. If not logged in → Redirected to `/editorial-assistant/login`
3. User logs in with editorial assistant credentials
4. After successful login → Redirected to `/editorial-assistant` dashboard

### **Test the Fix:**

1. **Open new incognito window**
2. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3000/editorial-assistant`
3. **Expected**: Should redirect to `/editorial-assistant/login`
4. **Login with**: `editorial.assistant@amhsj.org` / `password123`
5. **Expected**: Should redirect to `/editorial-assistant` dashboard

The editorial assistant now has their own dedicated login flow! 🎉
