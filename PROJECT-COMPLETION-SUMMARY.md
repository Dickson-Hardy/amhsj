SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as new_users,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN role = 'admin' THEN 1 END) as admin_count
FROM users 
WHERE created_at >= $1 
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at);

-- Review Performance Metrics
SELECT 
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - assigned_at)) / 86400) as avg_days,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed,
  COUNT(*) as total_reviews
FROM reviews 
WHERE assigned_at >= $1;

-- System Health Monitoring
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN details LIKE '%error%' THEN 1 END) as errors,
