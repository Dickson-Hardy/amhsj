# Dashboard Real Data Implementation Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. **Removed Mock Data Dependencies**
- Replaced all mock data references with actual API calls
- Implemented role-based data fetching (Authors vs Editors)
- Added proper error handling for failed API calls

### 2. **Created Section-Based APIs for Editors**

#### New API Endpoints:
- **`/api/sections/[section]/stats`** - Section-specific statistics
- **`/api/sections/[section]/submissions`** - Section submissions with pagination
- **`/api/user/profile`** - User profile with editor section assignments

#### API Features:
- **Section Stats**: Total submissions, status counts, pending actions, acceptance rates
- **Section Submissions**: Filtered by section with author info, review counts, action flags
- **User Profile**: Editor sections, role verification, primary section detection

### 3. **Enhanced Dashboard Functionality**

#### For Editors:
- **Section Selector**: Multi-section editors can switch between assigned sections
- **Section Badge**: Single-section editors see current section
- **Section-Specific Data**: All stats and submissions filtered by selected section
- **Real-time Section Switching**: Instant data refresh when changing sections

#### For Authors:
- **Personal Data**: Original author-focused dashboard with personal submissions
- **Activity Tracking**: Recent activities based on submission history
- **Progress Monitoring**: Enhanced submission tracking with action flags

### 4. **Improved User Experience**

#### Smart Section Detection:
1. **Editor Profiles**: Uses `assignedSections` from `editorProfiles` table
2. **Specializations**: Falls back to user specializations
3. **Expertise**: Uses expertise areas as final fallback
4. **Default**: "General" section if no other data available

#### Enhanced Data Processing:
- **Progress Tracking**: Updated to include `technical_check` status
- **Priority Calculation**: Faster turnaround expectations for technical checks
- **Action Flags**: Clear indication of submissions needing editor attention

### 5. **Database Integration**

#### Tables Used:
- **`articles`**: Main submission data with status and category
- **`users`**: Author and editor information
- **`editorProfiles`**: Section assignments and workload
- **`reviews`**: Review counts and completion status

#### Optimized Queries:
- **Aggregated Stats**: Single query for all section statistics
- **Joined Data**: Efficient author+submission data retrieval
- **Filtered Results**: Section-based filtering with pagination support

### 6. **Error Handling & Fallbacks**

#### Robust API Handling:
- **Network Errors**: Graceful fallback to empty states
- **Permission Errors**: Proper unauthorized responses
- **Data Errors**: Activity generation from submissions when APIs fail

#### User Experience:
- **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators during data fetching
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly error handling with logging
- **Fallback Content**: Default values when data is unavailable
