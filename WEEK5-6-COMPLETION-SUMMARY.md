## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Integration
```sql
-- Advanced SQL queries implemented:
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as registrations,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN role = 'admin' THEN 1 END) as admin_count
FROM users 
WHERE created_at >= $1 
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Performance metrics with complex aggregations:
SELECT 
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - assigned_at)) / 86400) as avg_review_days,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed_reviews
FROM reviews 
WHERE assigned_at >= $1;
```
