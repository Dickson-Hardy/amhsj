# Author Profile Page Error Fix

## Issue Summary
The `AuthorProfilePage` component was throwing an error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" at line 1038. This was caused by:

1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The component expected arrays like `academicCredentials` and `publications` but the API returned different data structure
2. **Undefined Array Access**: The code was trying to read `.length` on potentially undefined arrays
3. **Missing Error Handling**: The component didn't handle cases where expected arrays might be undefined

## Root Cause
The API endpoint `/api/user/profile` returns user profile data with fields like:
- `expertise: string[]`
- `specializations: string[]` 
- `researchInterests: string[]`
- `languagesSpoken: string[]`

But the component was expecting:
- `academicCredentials: AcademicCredential[]`
- `publications: Publication[]`
- `emailPreferences: EmailPreferences`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Interface Definition
```typescript
interface AuthorProfile {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  role: string
  affiliation: string
  bio: string
  orcid: string
  orcidVerified: boolean
  specializations: string[]
  expertise: string[]
  researchInterests: string[]
  languagesSpoken: string[]
  profileCompleteness: number
  isActive: boolean
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
  // Optional arrays that might not be present
  academicCredentials?: AcademicCredential[]
  publications?: Publication[]
  emailPreferences?: EmailPreferences
}
```

### 2. Added Null/Undefined Checks
- Changed `profile.academicCredentials.length` to `!profile.academicCredentials || profile.academicCredentials.length === 0`
- Changed `profile.publications.length` to `!profile.publications || profile.publications.length === 0`
- Added optional chaining for email preferences: `profile.emailPreferences?.submissionUpdates || false`

### 3. Updated Form Fields
- Replaced `firstName` and `lastName` with single `name` field
- Updated institutional fields to match API structure
- Added proper array handling for expertise, specializations, and research interests
- Made email field read-only (shouldn't be editable)

### 4. Fixed Data Handling Functions
- Updated `addCredential()`, `removeCredential()`, and `updateCredential()` to handle potentially undefined arrays
- Updated `handleSave()` to send data in the format expected by the API

### 5. Fixed Auth.ts Logger Issue
- Replaced all `logger.error()` calls with `logError()` function calls
- Added proper imports for `AppError` and `ValidationError` classes

## Files Modified
1. `/app/author/profile/page.tsx` - Fixed component structure and data handling
2. `/lib/auth.ts` - Fixed logger references and imports

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to `/author/profile` 
3. Verify the page loads without errors
4. Test editing profile information
5. Confirm data saves properly

## Expected Behavior
- Profile page should load without errors
- All form fields should display current user data
- Edit mode should work properly
- Save functionality should update the profile
- Arrays should display as comma-separated values for editing
